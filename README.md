## Overview

This repository contains an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline developed in Python that consumes data from the public DummyJSON API, using the following endpoints:

- https://dummyjson.com/users  
- https://dummyjson.com/products  

The pipeline extracts, cleans, transforms, and stores the data in Parquet format, making it ready for analysis.

This project was developed as part of an academic practical assignment.
